I am a Frontend Developer proficient in the modern JavaScript stack with experience using the latest web technologies including React.js, Node, GraphQL and Typescript. I also have hands-on experience with AWS on the cloud, particularly EC2 and S3. Always looking to improve myself I love contributing to Agile software companies building amazing experiences on the Web. I care about writing clean code, working collaboratively, and learning new technologies.

After years of being fascinated by programming and software development (I started creating websites for small clients more than 5 years ago) I decided to turn my side gig into a profession and build a professional career as a frontend developer. With the aim of professionalizing my skills I successfully graduated from General Assembly gaining proficiency in JavaScript technology and started my software development career.

Currently I work at Hargreaves Lansdown as a Frontend Developer.

As a hobby, I like playing the drums, playing football and learning about new technologies.

Technologies: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Next JS, Node, GraphQL, AWS(S3, EC2), CI/CD, Headless CMS (Kontent by Kentico), Azure Pipelines, Google Cloud Platform, REST API, Git, Gitlab, Jest, Enzyme, React Testing Library, Cypress, Tailwind, SASS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Express.
